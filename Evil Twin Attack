What is an Evil Twin Attack?
An evil twin attack is a type of Wi-Fi hack where a cybercriminal sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point with the same name (SSID) as a legitimate network. 
Unsuspecting users connect to it, thinking it’s the real network. All data sent through the fake network can then be monitored or stolen by the attacker.
-Common on public Wi-Fi networks like coffee shops, libraries, or airports.
-Can be created with a smartphone, laptop, or Wi-Fi Pineapple.

##### How Evil Twin Attacks Work  ###########
1. Finding the right location – Attackers target busy public Wi-Fi spots.
2. Setting up a fake access point – They copy the SSID of a legitimate network.
3. Attracting victims – Stronger signal or automatic device connections lure users.
4. Fake login page (captive portal) – Users may enter credentials, which the hacker captures.
5. Data theft – The attacker can monitor browsing, steal passwords, and even access bank accounts.

######## Why Evil Twin Attacks Are Dangerous ###########
-Hackers can steal login credentials, financial data, and personal information.
-Malware can be injected into your device.
-Victims often don’t notice until it’s too late.

Example
A person connects to a coffee shop’s Wi-Fi, but the hacker has set up an evil twin with a stronger signal. 
When the person logs into their bank account without a VPN, the hacker steals their credentials and money.

######## Rogue Access Point vs Evil Twin ##########
-Rogue Access Point: Unauthorized device plugged into a network to bypass security.
-Evil Twin: Fake network mimicking a legitimate one to trick users into connecting.
-An evil twin is a type of rogue access point.

What to Do if Victimized
-Contact your bank or credit card company immediately.
-Change all passwords.
-Report to local authorities if necessary.

####### Protection Tips #######
-Avoid unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots.
-Use your personal hotspot instead of public Wi-Fi.
-Check warning notifications from your device.
-Disable auto-connect for networks.
-Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi.
-Use multi-factor authentication.
-Stick to HTTPS websites.
-Use a VPN to encrypt your data.
-Install comprehensive internet security software.

****** Always be cautious with public Wi-Fi. Even if the network looks familiar, 
an evil twin could be waiting to steal your data. *********
